This is a repo of my implementation of Langton's ant algorithm

Files:

- ant.png - used as ant image 

- langtons_ant.py - the first and the simplest version of 
    Langton's ant(badly optimized)
    - If you want Ant class, it's nessesary to have
     global black_cells variable(list)

- langtons_ant_multiple.py - Many ants are better than only one :D
    - using Ant from langtons_ant.py so it works the same way

- langtons_ant_optimized.py - optimized version of Langton's ant
    - Ant - works almost like Ant from langtons_ant.py. 
    If you want to import it, it's nessesary to have
     global black_sells and white_sells variables(dicts).
    You also make Ant child class and overwrite 'move' method.
    - Also included cool features like running animation on 'Enter' key
     and stopping it on 'Space' key

-  langtons_ant_multiple_optimized.py - version that includes
 all good sides from langtons_ant_optimized.py.

Also, .py files contain comments, read them for better understanding

Thank you for reading this!

This is Langton's ant repository

Files:

- ant.png - ant image 

- langtons_ant.py - first and the simplest version of Langton's ant(bad optimized)
    - Ant - class of ant(you can import it and use everywhere, but it's needed to have global black_cells variable(list) isn't used for everything else. Also, you can create child class of it, and there will be no problem, if you overwrite 'move' method)

- langtons_ant_multiple.py - Multiple ants are better than only one :D
    - using Ant from langtons_ant.py so it works the same way

- langtons_ant_optimized.py - optimized version of Langton's ant
    - Ant - works almost like Ant from langtons_ant.py, but it's needed to have global black_sells and white_sells variables(dicts) aren't used if you import it. Still no problem if you make child class and overwrite 'move' method
    - Also included cool features like running animation on 'Enter' key and stopping it on 'Space' key

-  langtons_ant_multiple_optimized.py - version that include all good sides from langtons_ant_optimized.py. So, i don't need list 
    them again (Horray!)

Also, .py files contain comments, read them for better understanding
